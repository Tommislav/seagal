Seagal v2.0
Designed for speed!

I want each system to describe which components it is interested in.
Every time we add a new entity, or add/remove a component, we update the lists in the systems
so that they always have an array of entity ids, and an array with the matching component for that entity
for each component type that was registred.

Something like

::System::
onInit
	registerInterest(PositionComponent, RenderComponent)

onUpdate
	(arrays already populated)
	[entity0, entity3, entity9]
	[PositionComponent0, PositionComponent3, PositionComponent9]
	[RenderComponent0, RenderComponent3, RenderComponent9]

we can still ask entityManager for components, but that will be slower
